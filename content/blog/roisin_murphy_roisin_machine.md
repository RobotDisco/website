## Disco / Not Disco {#disco-not-disco}

Disco is apparently a style that comes back from time to time, and it had a particular renaissance. Best I can tell it's because disco is a great fun and escapist form of music during a stressful 2020, but I imagine many of these albums were written before the pandemic.

Disco is a music I came by later in life, as I was very much an alternative rocker as a kid and a lot of punk's anti-disco sentiment still carried into the 90s (and contemporary extensions, like euro-dance, carried social tensions against the goths and the punks and the rockers in my school and thus dance music in general was suspect by association for its own reasons.)

Since I've grown older and developed a more open appreciation for music, I've sometimes dabbled in funk and pop but I'm not really that familiar with its forms. I have read that Disco in its original forms was closer to funk, often with live instrumentation before it turned into the birth of DJ culture, not to mention the Motown and soul that preoccupied a lot of northern British dance-halls that influenced a lot of the punk and post-punk I did gravitate towards as a kid.


## I just realized that I'm writing about the title of my blog {#i-just-realized-that-i-m-writing-about-the-title-of-my-blog}

For a long time dancable music was a thing I didn't think I had the mind or body for. As I explored post-punk though, I realized that a lot of post-punk bands enjoyed making music that was essentially dance music but warped into some kind of [Mutant Disco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBBuC3Vvzt8) that was the 80s equivalent of being transgressive (as cute as that seems in the "edgy"-comedian era and whatever strife-filled zeitgeist we currently live in.)

A professor of mine introduced me to the music of Jamie Lidell, who in the 2010s put out a collection of wonderful  [dance](https://vimeo.com/57927567) [songs](https://vimeo.com/69535712) that sounded like it was written by a robot or at least someone who was not all about the bombastic feeling and physicality that most dance music seems to be about. Similarly, there was Matthew Dear, whose discography seems unabashedly that of a Pygmalion [construct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7GB8IJs6ic) constructing its understanding of acting human through dance music.

But those to me didn't really register as pop music because I had always heard them through "alternative" or heady EDM labels like Warp and such.


## 2020 pop {#2020-pop}

Pop music is a thing I'm beginning to come by, from understanding the machinations of Taylor Swift to appreciating what a lot of young singers (Ariana Grande, Carly Rae Jepson bring to the table) and it's neat to think about modes of music that have an overall different cultivating environment than the lyricism and self-claimed-outsider ethics of alternative music during my youth. But I can't speak much to that except saying that Taylor Swift is a really interesting person to read up on how modern folk construct pop music and it's really interesting how transparent she is about her own trail in making pop art something the artists themselves can own (I don't think most people can afford to do that and the bandcamp generation business model doesn't adapt to pop yet, but maybe one day her effort will lead others down to that road.)

Anyway, a bunch of artists have been writing straight up disco, which is the original thing I wanted to say before meandering through my head at other music. Artists such as Dua Lipa and Kylie Minogue, who I'm not really familiar with, have written albums, and I listened to them out of curiosity because the cultural aspects of modern pop fascinate me though I don't currently understand them, and the reason I am currently interested in disco is because their 2020 disco-themed albums kept coming up over and over in musical discussions so that is some of what the hip people today are listening to I guess. I don't have a good enough feel for those albums to say anything about them, other than slightly preferring Lipa's over Minogue's which felt too professional and too "I know what I'm doing, here is a form."


## Róisín Machine {#róisín-machine}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/Roisin-Machine.jpg" >}}

Someone else who kept getting mentioned was someone named Róisín Murphy, who I've never heard about before. Her album cover was interesting in that it didn't look anything like I'd expect from a pop star. I figured it was a deliberate call-out to the look of disco albums.

The album started with a song called [Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJcEudyi4pw) which is a very slow robotic very trans-human track. At first I was like "this is not escapist disco" but I did get trapped into the disco drum. I started filing this back into the alternative music genre.

But by tracks such as [Jealousy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOKB5-DGI0&list=RDZmOKB5-DGI0&start%5Fradio=1) and [Murphy's Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%5FKhh8NB-qBo&list=RDZmOKB5-DGI0&index=2) I was like hells yea, this is dance music I can swing my butt to. And it <span class="underline">really</span> felt like a throwback unlike that original song, this felt very much like someone saying "what would someone write in the 70s?" Which is both pleasant but nowadays, as I'm older and somewhat ashamed whenever I draw back into older forms of music instead of trying to find what is cool and new out there, but whatever.

The song where the album really clicked for me as special was in the song "[Incapable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzML3JO1Fxo)", which has a cool European backing track, but the lyrics centre around the singer asking if never having their heart broken means they are incapable of life (hearkening in both ways back to the deep fat bass and nonhuman musings of Matthew Dear). I also came across this "live at home" performance where the artists winds up doing heavy overwhelming tubular strobing overlay that turns her into a new Björk in aesthetic, even if the music is still straightforward love disco even with that alien bent (I guess that makes it similar to Debut)

That realizing that this album really is a fusion of mutant and disco even if it doesn't always play that up, possibly because it wasn't a pretense but is the outcome of an emergent artistic process, I think has placed this album into my top finds of 2020/2021, especially as more videos suggest the artist is beyond having a front (her @ home videos have this fun property of the artist setting up however they want to perform and not really seeming like they care that it's a home-recorded presentation, albeit with very well-crafted performance overlays.)


## That which Gaelan overlooked. {#that-which-gaelan-overlooked-dot}

As I read more up on Murphy it turns out she was the singer in the band [Moloko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTjyhydMURI)! I used to own their debut album and I enjoyed it, but it faded in time as one of the many not-remembered albums of 90s trip-hop that I used to very much enjoy (but didn't stick to my craw like Portishead and Lamb did.)

This has also given me an opportunity to catch up on that era of Murphy's work, as I get to find [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqnSIBEwQ%5F0&list=PLP59Fs%5FhB7C2O-buP2ce-aPnwalmpH8wp) from albums [beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GY9DWIfpwc) the debut which I owned, and realized that I would have really enjoyed it. And she has a bunch of other solo albums too!

Anyway, I'm really excited to fill out my knowledge of Róisín Murphy evolution from then till now. And I'm really thankful for her giving me an emotional wedge into finding my place in dance music and disco, which I'll probably start looking into and maybe working some swing into my bustling around the house!
