My workplaces, and the workplaces of many of my friends, have been all-a-tizzy about a [recent workplace study](https://autonomy.work/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ICELAND%5F4DW.pdf) from Iceland which investigated the merits of a 35 or 36-hour work week. It is an interesting read that I highly recommend.


## Everyone is calling this a four-day work-week study, but it is not that. {#everyone-is-calling-this-a-four-day-work-week-study-but-it-is-not-that-dot}

The shorthand reference to this study is often termed something like "Iceland's four-day work week", which is not really accurate. The study itself focuses on _reducing hours per week_, and the study itself doesn't really mention anything about a count of days.

From some of the anecdotes found within the study it does sound like <span class="underline">some</span> of the participants did have a three day weekend, but that was by no means the only way the participants reduced their work hours during the trial. The study itself did not even recommend a strategy beyond the reduction of hours.


## What the study said, to my best understanding {#what-the-study-said-to-my-best-understanding}

My understanding of the study is as follows:

Iceland employees work far more hours per week on average than similar Scandinavian countries, and were on the high end of hours worked per week compare to other (mostly European, if I remember correctly) countries mentioned in the document.

Many Icelandic respondents to the authors claimed that they felt an overall lack of time and fatigue.

The study found that reducing hours by five/six **did not reduce productivity (as expressed as company revenue)** but in fact often increased it.

This was not a "reduced" work week. Nobody's compensation went down because of the loss of four working hours. This was a normalization of the full working week as having 35 or 36 hours instead of 40.

The study looked at a number of workplaces; a daycare and a municipal government spring to mind. At least some shift-work representation was mentioned.

The study highlighted anecdotal feedback from individual participants, saying for the most part that they appreciated the additional time which allowed them to have a better home life and to feel more relaxed in general.

The study noted that self-reported overtime was not that prevalent, suggesting that most people did not feel squeezed by the lost hours despite feeling that they were getting an equivalent amount of work done.


## The study let companies pick how they shortened their hours and did not recommend a strategy. {#the-study-let-companies-pick-how-they-shortened-their-hours-and-did-not-recommend-a-strategy-dot}

It should be noted that only half a "typical" 40-our work day was reduced by this study. Workplaces chose different strategies of their own accord on how to manage this reduction.

Some people worked four days of nine hours, while others simply reduced one work day into a half-day relative to the others.

The study did not note any particular differences in "success" in comparing workpace reduction hours.


## Friction was introduced by these changes, even though people were generally positive about the results. {#friction-was-introduced-by-these-changes-even-though-people-were-generally-positive-about-the-results-dot}

Managers seemed to particularly feel that they found they could not complete their duties under the shortened work hour allocation.

Additionally, since the end of a work-week is often when certain social occasions such as farewell parties or social events or other kinds of non-work-related activities happen, those were often the kinds of events that wound up being difficult to maintain into the new scheme.

The study did not seem to find that people found these issues as critical enough to consider the results a negative for the whole organization.


## Some things that seem worth mentioning to me. {#some-things-that-seem-worth-mentioning-to-me-dot}

It is interesting reading this from a North American context, where as far as I can tell our official work hours resemble the current Iceland amount, and North American self-conceptions tend to stress a sense of workaholism and a sense of envy towards an idea of Europe as a far more relaxed environment. I do not know enough about anything to know whether this is an accurate description of North American working habits.

Because I am in the tech industry, a lot of discourse I pick up on is tech-centric. The study didn't really address our kinds of environments in particular, although I think there are lots of generalities that apply. As such, I find a lot of people project the nature of tech work onto the study, even though a lot of the workaholism I have noticed in non-video-game tech industries is self-inflicted as part of our self-adopted culture of "hustle.". To some degree I am more interested about how this kind of study winds up resonating across industries that are far less kind to their employee base than that of tech leadership towards their tech employees.


## Is this a pandemic artifact? {#is-this-a-pandemic-artifact}

The mildly cynical person in me wonders why so many workplaces have gotten excited about this study. From my limited viewpoint of a tech worker in a company whose outlook towards workplace health is one I look favourably on, I suspect that there is a realization in a lot of relatively-benevolent white-collar workplaces that positive reception and a promised non-impact on productivity will make for a good differentiation for potential employees.

This is a particularly appealing aspect, I think, given how so many companies are trying to figure out how to deal with their workplace character now that we do not have to be remote-only by necessity. For employee bases that have realized that there are a lot of life advantages to working remotely or not having to be anchored to urban centres, their workplaces are themselves realizing that they:

-   have to keep tabs on their overall employee morale in a distributed fashion
-   cannot rely on the inertia of a centralized environment of shared presence to keep unideal communication and workplace behaviours going
-   can lose employees or fail to attract new employees and can no longer depend on physical proximity as a factor.

That, mixed with a possibly very human realization that a company's employee bases are real human people who have had for the most part an unprecedented ordeal over the last year and and a half, have placed a new stress on having a companies employees feel like their administration is actually looking out for them.


## What this means to me {#what-this-means-to-me}

I will have the opportunity to try out this reduced schedule in August, I am not viscerally excited, but I am am curious.

I remember very early on in the pandemic that a four day work week was a not-unrealistic possibility, albeit one of voluntarily reduced hours. We are a tech company in the retail space, and as you can imagine we assumed that our customer base would be devastated and that we would be directly impacted by that.

Amongst the many strategies my company made to reduce headcount as little as possible by reducing expenses in every other way, one option was for willing participants to take a voluntary workweek reduction to three of four paid working days, or even an unpaid sabbatical.

This never came to pass thanks to government stimulus, programs, non-people-related cost cutting measures (although we did lose more than zero people, and that was too many),  and strategic pivoting that wound up mitigating the impact from our customer base.

But still, I spent much time wondering what I would do with an extra day of recuperation, and I must admit that when we were told that the volunteer reduction was no longer on the table, I felt some disappointment.


## What would I do with three days of rest? {#what-would-i-do-with-three-days-of-rest}

I am inclined to try the four day cadence of nine hours because it is the most alien to me. Based on my evening struggles to transition from a workplace mental state to one of evening relaxation, I felt that I would not be making the most of my workplaces experiment by reducing myself down to a half-day, or simply working one less hour for four days.

I am considering the following aspirational calendar for a three-day weekend:

-   A day dedicated to deep work on hobbies: my homelab, hobby programming, and practicing intense research of topics that interest me.
-   A day of recuperation: television, social gathering, wandering about town.
-   A day for chores.

Whenever I have taken long vacations this pandemic I have appreciated full days dedicated to chores or purposeless meanderings (I will include socialization in there although it doesn't always apply) without feeling like I am compromising on my other intense interests.


## How will I manage an extra hour of work per workday? {#how-will-i-manage-an-extra-hour-of-work-per-workday}

I am very curious about this. I am of two minds currently:


### An opportunity for even more intentional workday {#an-opportunity-for-even-more-intentional-workday}

I already feel like it takes too long for my brain to transition into relaxation on weekends. By the time I feel that I have fully removed the tension and background activity my work focus generates, it is already time to start preparing for the next day. In that sense, I consider my evenings a wash regardless, only good enough for life rituals and some really basic decompression.

Conversely, it is fairly noncontroversial that most people do not have seven hours of energy for focus time, let alone mine. Will I find that I will have to hone my intentionality by adding more deliberate time for other kinds of work, the communication and reflection and random odds and sods that need to be done without threatening the rare and precious moments of unadultered focus time one steals from their working environments at the best of times?


### Parkinson's law and the danger of exhaustion {#parkinson-s-law-and-the-danger-of-exhaustion}

I must consider a friends' experience, however, which is that she works four ten-hour days currently, with three day weeks. She does not find them a boon, for she also feels that evenings seem to disappear and that she uses that supposedly additional day just to catch up on sleep and mindspace and focus. As such, it does not feel like a win at all.

How much of this is because this seeming benefit comes from the novelty of a study, where I an actively thinking about how to spend my time in a fresh way? Once the novelty of this pattern wears off or the very real gremlins that attack one's best intentions come out in full force and interruption, will I find that a third day of rest passes with the same amount of blur as the current two when I as verklempt as I too commonly am?

I look forward to recording personal data and having a personal first impression.
